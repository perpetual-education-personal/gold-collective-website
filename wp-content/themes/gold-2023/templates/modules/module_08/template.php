        <p>Photography is a lot like love - you can follow all the rules, but you won't find something truly beautiful unless you go with your gut.<span class="optional"> We draw on our experience and training to capture not just the who/what/where of your day, but the emotions and spirit of it as well. What we won't do is just check shots off a list and then call it a day.</span></p>
